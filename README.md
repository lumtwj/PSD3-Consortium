PSD3 Consortium Sprint 1 - Implementation
=============
## Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Download zip folder and unzip
2. Import project to Eclipse as "General > Existing Projects into Workspace"
3. Select the root directory that u have unzip the project
4. Check "Copy projects into workspace" and click on "Finish"
5. From Terminal/Cygwin change directory to the project in your workspace and use the following command
  * ant resolve â€“ Generate library required from build.xml
6. Go back to Eclipse
  * Configure your build path to include all the jar files in to the project
7. You are done importing and setting up the projects!

---

## Generate file for installation
1. After creating component, please edit the manifest folder and make sure that in bundles, you have already added your component so that your .jar file is being created. 

2. DO NOT CHANGE THE build.xml FILE! 
The build.xml is like your makefile. While running 'ant run' function, it will run 3 command all together.

	1. ant osgi.init
	2. ant osgi.run
	3. ant bundles

I've already added the bundles in so that it the stuff can be easily edited. The folder has already been customised that as long as you import this folder in, you can go into your cygwin/terminal and run 'ant resolve' and 'ant run'. PLEASE also remember that if you are running on Eclipse, you will need to add reference library too, if not you will face a lot of error. 

As for the running, I've already name the external db as login.jar and Joe already had his as test.jar, you just have to type

install file:test.jar
install file:login.jar

start <id> 
stop <id>

If you have make changes to the .java file and want to test it out, just do the following code. 

stop 0
ant run
update <id> 

If you have no idea what is the id you have previously, type lb to check. 
For my component, you should see the follow result.

install file:login.jar
         [] g! Bundle ID: 5
start 5
         [] g! Got Connection
